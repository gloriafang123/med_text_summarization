In recent years, the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in medical imaging has shown improved performance in terms of mass detection and classification compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This paper proposes a fully automated framework to detect masses in Full-Field Digital Mammograms (FFDM). This is based on the Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster-RCNN) model and is applied for detecting masses in the large-scale OPTIMAM Mammography Image Database (OMI-DB), which consists of ∼80,000 FFDMs mainly from Hologic and General Electric (GE) scanners. This research is the first to benchmark the performance of deep learning on OMI-DB. The proposed framework obtained a True Positive Rate (TPR) of 0.93 at 0.78 False Positive per Image (FPI) on FFDMs from the Hologic scanner. Transfer learning is then used in the Faster R-CNN model trained on Hologic images to detect masses in smaller databases containing FFDMs from the GE scanner and another public dataset INbreast (Siemens scanner). The detection framework obtained a TPR of 0.91±0.06 at 1.69 FPI for images from the GE scanner and also showed higher performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on the INbreast dataset, obtaining a TPR of 0.99±0.03 at 1.17 FPI for malignant and 0.85±0.08 at 1.0 FPI for benign masses, showing the potential to be used as part of an advanced CAD system for breast cancer screening.
